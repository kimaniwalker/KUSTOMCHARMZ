                            <p>We'll keep it ðŸ’¯ with you, always. Our products aren't just thrown together just to make some quick cash. We thouroughly test and experiement with them before putting them on the market. Now that doesn't mean you can just go treating them any kind of way! We only ever recommend products to you that we truly love and back 100 percent. The merchandise we feature on our site are always driven by personal experiences and relationships.</p>
                            <h6 className="py-2"><strong>The "Handmaking" Process</strong></h6>
                            <p>Finding ways to make the world a better place by sourcing our materials sustainably and finding eco-friendly materials to use is our top priority. We source our beads from family owned businesses that follow sustainable practices. Once we have our materials we handmake our bracelets with love. You can count on us if thoughtful purchases are important to you, too.</p>
